To install this package, you will need to have access to some of the
header files in R that are not installed when R is installed on the
system. So it is easiest to install the package from a version of R
that is not installed but run directly from the directory in which it
was built. However, all that is necessary is to specify the location
of the directory containing the file <code>IOStuff.h</code>. That is
found in the <code>src/include/</code> directory of the R source tree.
You can tell the package where this directory is in either of two
ways.
<dl>
  <dt> 
  <li> You can set the environment variable
      <code>R_INCLUDE_DIR</code> to the name of the
      fully qualified   src/include  directory
  <dd>
      This is done as
<pre>
 setenv R_INCLUDE_DIR <i>/wherever/R/source/is/</i>src/include
</pre>
for the Csh/Tcsh shells or
<pre>
 export R_INCLUDE_DIR=<i>/wherever/R/source/is/</i>src/include
</pre>
for the Bourne shell (sh/bash).

  <dt>
  <li> You specify the directory via the
       <code>--with-R-includes</code> flag for the configuration
      file.
  <dd>
<pre>
 R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-R-includes=<i>/wherever/R/source/is</i>/src/include' REventLoop
</pre>      
</dl>
