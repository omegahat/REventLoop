Title: Event loop package for R
Author: Duncan Temple Lang (duncan@research.bell-labs.com)
Depends: R (>= 1.6.0)
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@research.bell-labs.com>
Description: An abstract event loop mechanism  that is toolkit 
 independent and can be used to to replace the R event loop.
 This allows one to use the Gtk or Tcl/Tk's event loop which 
 gives better response and coverage of all event sources 
 (e.g. idle events, timers, etc.)
